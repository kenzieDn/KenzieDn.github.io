        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>This project involves creating an HR presence system using Power BI. The system analyzes employee attendance and sick leave to help make informed decisions about scheduling and event planning. The data, sourced from Atliq, a company in India, was processed using Power Query to merge sheets, clean the data, and create new columns for slicers and measures.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>1. Data Collection: The data was collected from the company's HR system, stored in an Excel file.<br>
        2. Data Cleaning: Using Power Query, the data was cleaned by changing data types, removing duplicates, and merging sheets.<br>
        3. Data Analysis: Measures were created to analyze the data, such as calculating the percentage of employees working physically vs. from home, and the percentage of sick leave.<br>
        4. Data Visualization: Various charts and slicers were created in Power BI to visualize the data trends, helping to make decisions about scheduling and event planning.</p>

        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <p>A significant challenge was ensuring the accuracy of the merged data. This was addressed by meticulously checking the merged sheets and using Power BI's validation features. Another challenge was creating meaningful measures and slicers, which was solved by consulting HR stakeholders to understand their needs better.</p>

        <h2>Outcome and Impact</h2>
        <p>The project provided valuable insights into employee attendance and sick leave patterns, helping the company plan large events and understand seasonal sick leave trends. Future improvements include extending the data analysis to a full year and integrating it with other HR systems for real-time updates.</p>
